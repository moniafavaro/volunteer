# Volunteer

# Description

Second solo project with GA.

Designed a website for posting and applying for volunteering jobs. A company can post jobs and a volunteer can apply for them. 

Timeframe: 1 week.

# Inspiration

At the end of the course we all started to talk about finding a job, then I realised that I would like to do a volunteer job and it would be very nice to go to a website with only volunteering jobs.

The design was "inspired" by `indeed`.

# Getting Started

I started to think about this website and already had an image on my mind of how I wanted it to be.

So I started with the wireframe.

Once the wireframe was done I started with the pseudocode and decided what I wanted to add to this website.

This is the wireframe for one-to-many and many-to-many relationships:

The first pages that I added was the login and register:

After that I did the home and profile page to the company and volunteer.

That was my MVP.

# How to Use it

You are able to register as a company (who can post jobs) or as a volunteer (who can apply for jobs).

If you register as a company and login you will be redirected to the company profile, where you can add the description of your company.

When you as a company go to the home page you are able to add opening jobs and/or close a job. You can also see all the volunteers that apply for a job.

If you register as a volunteer and login you will be redirected to the volunteer profile, where you can add your information like phone number and CV.

On the volunteer home page you can see all the open jobs and apply for then with just one click on the apply button.

After that it is up to the company to contact the volunteer and the volunteer to answer to the company.


# Frameworks Used

* Python
* Django
* JavaScript
* ReactJS
* SASS
* Bootstrap
* Google Fonts
* VS Code
* Chrome
* Git and GitHub

# Challenges

Building a full stack application on your own for the first time is something to be proud of. Problem solving and taking time to think through the errors has for sure given me some valuable experience prior to entering the industry.

# Wins

For me, my biggest win was to learn how to implement one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.

# Future Enhancements

* Make my search bar useful, so volunteers can search for a job or company.
